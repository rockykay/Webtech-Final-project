# Webtech-Final-project


this is a webtech project i worked really hard to have this project running the project consists of 6 modules there is a fleet management system which is the main 
and there is the HR for managing employee data there is also the Accounts module that is supposed to manage the user Accounts and make sure they can be assigned different user privileges and roles, there's also the helpdesk that is in charge of managing tickets for vehicle hire and requisitions also there's the reports which is in charge of storing reports but on that i am still working on a way to make the reports Automatic instead of putting them in manually there's also a security module that lets you create roles and the other one is parameters that makes it easy for the admin to create and manage certain data entities like countries depending on where the project is being used 



#The main dependencies you might want to check for are the : Mysql dependency for spring boot 
                                                            Thymeleaf for Spring boot 
                                                            Lombok for getters and setters
                                                            and the Spring security for thymeleaf 

                                                            
normally i am a python backend developer so adjusting to a complex language like java wasn't easy for me and also diving in frontend development wasn't an easy task i've never studied javascript in my life and this was my first time using it.
