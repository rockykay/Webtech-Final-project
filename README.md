# Webtech-Final-project


this is a webtech project i worked really hard to have this project running the project consists of 6 modules there is a fleet management system which is the main 
and there is the HR for managing employee data there is also the Accounts module that is supposed to manage the user Accounts and make sure they can be assigned different user privileges and roles, there's also the helpdesk that is in charge of managing tickets for vehicle hire and requisitions also there's the reports which is in charge of storing reports but on that i am still working on a way to make the reports Automatic instead of putting them in manually there's also a security module that lets you create roles and the other one is parameters that makes it easy for the admin to create and manage certain data entities like countries depending on where the project is being used 



The main dependencies you might want to check for are the : #Mysql dependency for spring boot 
                                                            #Thymeleaf for Spring boot 
                                                            #Lombok for getters and setters
                                                            #and the Spring security for thymeleaf 
there was also a usage of fonts like 
Bootstrap Framework (v3): The HTML structure includes references to Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files (bootstrap.min.css, bootstrap-theme.css, js/bootstrap.min.js). 

Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework for creating responsive and mobile-first websites.

Font Awesome: It's a font and icon toolkit used for adding scalable vector icons in the design. The code includes a reference to font-awesome.css.

HTML5 Shim and Respond.js: These are used for enabling HTML5 elements and CSS3 media queries for Internet Explorer versions less than 9 (html5shiv.js, respond.min.js).

and for javascript there was also frameworks like:
jQuery ($): The code starts with $(function(){...}), which is a shortcut for $(document).ready(function(){...}). This ensures that the enclosed code executes when the DOM is fully loaded.
WYSIWYG Editor Initialization: The $('#editor').wysiwyg(...) call initializes a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor on an element with the ID "editor". This functionality might be provided by a plugin or an extension built on top of jQuery.
Other Functions: There are various functions defined within the $(function(){...}) block, like initToolbarBootstrapBindings() and showErrorAlert(). These functions are specific to the WYSIWYG editor or its configuration.
                                                            
normally i am a python backend developer so adjusting to a complex language like java wasn't easy for me and also diving in frontend development wasn't an easy task i've never studied javascript in my life and this was my first time using it.
